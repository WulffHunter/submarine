To compile, enter into this directory and run `make`.
The resulting object file will be called `submarine`.
To run the object file, type `./submarine`.
To remove the compiled file, run `make clean`.

NOTE: My shaders make the texture a flat color. In order to show
    that I properly implemented shaders, I made the shaders
    toggleable. Press U to toggle it on/off.

Control scheme: WASD, Up/Down/Left/Right, Spacebar, P, R, E, C, Z, X, U

To move forward/backwards, press W/S respectively.
To rotate the submarine left/right, press A/D respectively.
To raise/lower the submarine, press the up/down keys respectively.
To toggle the propeller, press P. The P key turns the propeller
on and off.
To toggle the periscope, press E. Toggling the periscope off disables
first-person camera mode.
To toggle between first- and third-person, raise the periscope with E,
then press C to change modes.
To zoom the first-person camera in/out, press Z/X respecively.
To rotate the periscope, press Left/Right.
To align the submarine to the periscope's direction, press R.
To fire a torpedo, press the Spacebar.
To toggle shaders on/off, press U.


Get ready for the game that's gonna be bigger than Fortnite.

Enjoy!
